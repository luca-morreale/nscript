Version 1.0.0
=============

Visual interface for building ns-tcl scripts. Specifically, it allows you to:

* Build the topology by drawing it.
* Configure elements in the network, such as transport
  agents, and applications.
* Handle event scheduling for your simulation script.
* Trace and plot simulation information (you'll need gnuplot).

The information on how to add classes to the graphical environment is
detailed in the CUSTOMIZING file under the doc directory. In the same a
directory the file formats for a NS library is described, as well as
the VisualNS Documentation and Tutorial.

To make and run this application you'll need jdk1.3, and ns2.1b7 installed,
to use it. Move to the /src directory, and do a "make all".
